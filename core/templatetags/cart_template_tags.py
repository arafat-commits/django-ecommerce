In the python file, at first we have imported the tamplate from django and then imported the model we need 
for this functionality. Then we have created an instance of the template.Library() method. After all, to register 
the template we have used the decorators called "@register.filter" and then written a function which will return 
the total cart item count of the items we have in our order. That's it!
